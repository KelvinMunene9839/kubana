Information Gathered:
- The server listens on port 9000 but logs port 3000, causing confusion.
- Middleware cors() is used after app.listen, which is not correct.
- Syntax error in db.query callback: extra closing parenthesis before arrow function.
- Missing closing brace for app.get callback function.

Plan:
- Fix the port number in the console log to 9000 to match the listening port.
- Move app.use(cors()) before app.listen() to ensure middleware is applied.
- Correct the syntax of db.query callback by removing the extra parenthesis.
- Add the missing closing brace for the app.get callback.
- Add error handling for database connection if needed.

Dependent Files to be edited:
- backend/server.js

Followup steps:
- Test the server after fixing the code to ensure no errors.
- Verify the API endpoint '/' returns the expected data.

Please confirm if I can proceed with this plan to fix backend/server.js.
